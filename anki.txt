What is the definition of a parking function?; \(n\) cars declare their preference to park in \(n\) spots. If the spot is taken, they take the next available spot. All cars must park by the end of the process.
What was the motivation of Konheim and Weiss for the introduction of parking functions?; Efficient information storage and retrieval in large databases.
Which functions from \(p : \{ 1, \cdots, n\} \to \{ 1, \cdots, n\}\) are valid parking functions?; Sort the sequence \((p_i)\) into \((q_i)\). This is a valid parking function if \(q_i \leq i\) for all \(i \in \{ 1, \cdots, n\}\)
What is the definition of the prime parking functions \(p : \{ 1, \cdots, n\} \to \{ 1, \cdots, n\}\)?; Sort the sequence \((p_i)\) into \((q_i)\). This is a prime parking function if \(q_i \leq i\) for all \(i \in \{ 2, \cdots, n\}\)
What is the number of parking functions of length \(n\)?; \(|\mathrm{PF}(n) | = (n+1)^{n-1}\)
What is the number of prime parking functions of length \(n\)?; \(|\mathrm{PF}'(n) | = (n-1)^{n-1}\)
What data structure can be used to efficiently enumerate the parking functions?; \(n\)-ary trees
What is memoization?; Memoization is a technique in programming that involves storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
Provide an example use case where memoization is useful; The Fibonacci sequence
What is the asymptotic computational complexity of brute force enumeration of parking functions of length \(n\)?; \(\Theta(n^n)\)
